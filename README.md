# Detecting-Wireless-Relay-Attacks-in-NFC-using-Deep-Learning-
This study explores the application of (DL) to enhance security in (NFC).  Against particularly relay attacks, where attackers relay signals without need to break encryption or other protective measures. In this study, this method will be enhanced for detecting NFC relay attacks using RF fingerprints and deep learning via Bluetooth.
